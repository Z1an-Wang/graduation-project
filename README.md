Centrality based routing protocols implemented in the ONE simulator


The repository contains only the code I developed. This project is based on the ONE simulator. The detail info can be found in https://github.com/akeranen/the-one.

If you want to run the code, plesea download the entire code of the ONE simulator and copy the file into corresponding directory.

The code in `routing` has implemented the degree, closeness, bewteenness, bridging centrality routing protocols.

The static movement model call `StationaryPOI` is developed, which is used to test the routing protocols. The correpsonding simulation settings are in `projectTestSet`.

The `data` folder contains the map data about the static scenario and the Southwest Jiaotong university.
